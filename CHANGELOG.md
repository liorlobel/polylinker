# Changelog

This file exists because of the updater. Since v0.1.2 a copy of Polylinker can
tell you that a newer version exists, and until now there was nowhere to find
out what is in it before saying yes. A version number on its own is not
information, and "there is an update" without "here is what changed" is a
request to trust rather than to check.

The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions
are three numbers compared as numbers, not as text: `pl update` refuses anything
that is not numerically newer than the copy running it, so 0.1.10 is an upgrade
from 0.1.2 and never the reverse. That rule and the attack it exists to stop —
a signed rollback onto an older release with public vulnerabilities — are in
[`crates/pl-update/src/version.rs`](crates/pl-update/src/version.rs). This is
0.x, and no compatibility promise has been made yet.

**Nothing in any of these releases is code-signed.** Windows SmartScreen and
macOS Gatekeeper do not recognise the publisher and say so, on every version
below. The signing described under 0.1.2 covers the release *manifest*, which is
a different thing; [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md) is precise about
which guarantee is which.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file.
- `CITATION.cff`, so the repository is citable by people who have to cite their
  tools. There is no DOI; see the file.

### Fixed

- **The minimum Rust version was a guess, and the guess was wrong.**
  `Cargo.toml` declared `rust-version = "1.82"`, and `README-LINUX.txt` and the
  release notes told anyone whose glibc is too old for the Linux binaries that
  building from source needs Rust 1.82. That is advice aimed precisely at the
  people who cannot check it cheaply, and nothing had ever compiled this tree
  with 1.82: every toolchain step in both workflows is
  `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`. 1.82 does not get as far as compiling —
  `indexmap 2.14.0` in `Cargo.lock` is edition 2024, which cargo 1.82 refuses
  at the manifest. The floor is **1.92**, bounded from both sides: 1.92 checks
  the whole workspace clean, and 1.91.1 is rejected by the eight egui 0.35
  crates the editor depends on. All three copies of the number now say 1.92, a
  new `msrv` job in CI installs whatever `rust-version` declares and runs
  `cargo check --workspace --locked` on it, and a gate step fails if the prose
  and the manifest disagree.

  Nothing about the published binaries changes. What changes is that the
  number a reader acts on is now compiled against on every push.

Nothing else has landed since v0.1.3 that changes what the programs do: a
`cargo fmt` of the release-signature test, and a recount of the line count the
README asserts about itself.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **`pl update` reaches a repository that exists.** The compiled-in
  `RELEASE_BASE_URL` was `https://github.com/polylinker/polylinker`, an
  organisation nobody registered, so `pl update --check` returned 404 the first
  time it was pointed at the real internet. Every unit test passed throughout:
  they assert that a URL is *built* correctly from the constant, and none of
  them asserted that the constant was right.

  **If you are running 0.1.2, its updater cannot work and cannot tell you this
  release exists.** Download 0.1.3 from the releases page by hand.

### Added

- The signature CI actually produced is now a committed test fixture, together
  with the manifest it covers: the real `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the v0.1.2 release
  page and the real 64 signature bytes `openssl` produced on the runner from
  `POLYLINKER_RELEASE_KEY`. Everything else about signing was tested against
  keys the tests invent, which proves self-consistency — exactly what a pipeline
  signing with the wrong key would also have proved. This is the first test in
  which the private half and the compiled-in public half meet.
- Negative controls for it, because a test that only checks a valid signature
  passes against a verifier that returns `true`: a flipped bit in the manifest,
  a flipped bit in the signature, and a public key one bit away from the release
  key are each required to be refused.
- `.gitattributes` pins those two fixtures to LF. Their bytes are the message
  the signature was made over, so a CRLF checkout would change what was signed
  and fail the test on Windows alone — announcing that the release key does not
  match the compiled-in key, which would be false and is the most alarming thing
  this repository could say.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-06

The first signed release. Manifest signing and the updater's verification of it
had never met: nothing on a development machine can sign with the CI secret, and
the publish job only runs on a tag. This is the tag that tested it.

**Broken in this release:** `pl update` points at a GitHub organisation that
does not exist and returns 404 for every check. Fixed in 0.1.3, which 0.1.2
cannot tell you about. Everything else below works.

### Added

- **An Ed25519 signature over the release manifest.** Every release page now
  carries `SHA256SUMS.txt.sig` beside `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and prints the OpenSSL
  command to check it by hand. A checksum proves your download matches the
  release page; the signature proves the release page came from whoever holds
  the release key. The private half is a GitHub Actions secret,
  `POLYLINKER_RELEASE_KEY`, and is on no machine here.
- **The public key, compiled into `pl` and `polylinker`.** Only those two:
  `pl-mcp`, the Python extension module and the wasm build do not carry it,
  because none of them can update anything. The trust anchor is in the binary
  being replaced rather than fetched from the network, which is the whole point.
  Rotating that key needs every installed copy to be replaced by hand — there is
  **no revocation channel**, because a revocation channel is a network call.
  [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md) records that cost.
- **`crates/pl-update`, an opt-in updater**, meeting the four conditions
  `docs/RELEASING.md` had set for one before it was allowed to exist. It fetches
  `SHA256SUMS.txt` and `SHA256SUMS.txt.sig` into memory and verifies the
  signature *before it requests the platform artifact at all*; a failed
  signature means the artifact is never asked for and nothing is written. The
  download lands on a `.part` file and is renamed into place only if its
  SHA-256 matches the entry in the verified manifest. It then prints the path
  and stops: it replaces nothing, refuses to write into the directory it is
  running from, and running the new file is yours to do.
- **`pl update` and `pl update --check`.** One request, made because somebody
  typed the verb. No thread, no timer, no stored "last checked".
- **An update check in the desktop app, under Help, shipped off.** Turned on it
  asks once per launch and shows a notice pointing at the release page; it never
  downloads. A new installation contacts nothing, and a truncated or hand-edited
  settings file falls back to off rather than on.
- **SHA-512 and Ed25519 verification in `pl-core`**, hand-written and with no
  dependency, checked against Wycheproof vectors and adversarially tested.

### Changed

- The release notes and `docs/RELEASING.md` no longer say "no updater". They say
  no *auto*-updater, and describe the two opt-in paths. The distinction is the
  point: nothing runs on a timer and nothing installs anything.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **A Windows MSI installer**, `polylinker-0.1.1-windows-x64.msi`. It installs
  for you alone by default — no administrator, no elevation prompt — with "for
  everyone" offered for machines where you are one. It puts Polylinker in the
  Start Menu and in Settings → Apps and offers to put `pl` on your PATH. It
  **adds** Polylinker to the "Open with" list for eight extensions — `.dna`,
  `.gb`, `.gbk`, `.genbank`, `.fasta`, `.fa`, `.fna` and `.ab1` — and takes none
  of them away: it writes `OpenWithProgids` entries and never an extension's own
  default, so if SnapGene owns `.dna` on your machine it still does afterwards.
  The installer contacts nothing and registers no service, no scheduled task and
  no auto-updater — nothing it puts on the machine ever runs on its own, and
  `tools/ci.ps1` fails the build if any network or scheduling facility appears in
  the installer sources.
- The MSI's file list is generated from the same `SHA256SUMS.txt` the zip is
  verified against, rather than written out a second time, because a second list
  is how a licence text stops shipping.
- Install, verify and uninstall are exercised on a CI runner: every payload file
  under `LocalAppData`, the installed `pl.exe` reporting its own version, the
  Start Menu shortcut, the `.dna` handler registration, and a planted foreign
  default handler surviving both install and uninstall.

The portable zip is unchanged and still ships `Install-Polylinker.ps1` for
anyone who would rather run something they can read.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-05

First public release.

### Added

- **Three platforms**, each built on the operating system it runs on:
  `polylinker-0.1.0-windows-x64.zip`, `polylinker-0.1.0-macos-universal.tar.gz`
  (one binary for Apple Silicon and Intel) and
  `polylinker-0.1.0-linux-x64.tar.gz` (glibc 2.39 or newer).
- Each archive contains `polylinker` (the desktop editor), `pl` (the command
  line), `pl-mcp` (a read-only MCP server), the Python extension module, the
  licence texts that have to accompany every copy — `LICENSE.txt`, `NOTICE.txt`,
  `TRADEMARKS.md`, `features/NOTICE.txt` and seven font licences under
  `licences/` — a per-platform read-me, and a `SHA256SUMS.txt` covering all of
  them. The release page carries a second `SHA256SUMS.txt` over the three
  archives themselves. The Windows zip adds `Install-Polylinker.ps1`,
  `Install.cmd`, `README-WINDOWS.txt` and the icon.
- `tools/check-archive.ps1` asserts the required members of each archive **by
  name and per platform**, not by count: an empty archive agrees perfectly with
  an empty manifest, and a count cannot tell a missing binary from a missing
  licence.

### Known limitations at this release

- **Unsigned, on every platform.** No code-signing certificate and no Apple
  Developer ID. macOS Gatekeeper refuses the files until
  `com.apple.quarantine` is removed from them by hand; Windows SmartScreen warns
  on first run. Neither is an oversight, and the words for clicking past a
  security warning appear in nothing this project ships.
- **No updater of any kind.** `pl --version` printed the version and the commit
  and asked nobody anything. One was added in 0.1.2.
- **No manifest signature.** `SHA256SUMS.txt` shipped unsigned, so the release
  page proved integrity and not origin. Added in 0.1.2.
